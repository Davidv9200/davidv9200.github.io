# CCNA Exam v1.0 200-301

The goal of this post is to provide a somewhat comprehensive guide to the Cisco Certified Network Associate certification. Whilst there are plenty of brilliant free and paid websites, books, and video courses available for the CCNA 301, I found them to be somewhat obtuse, leading to topics bleeding into one another which I personal I find this makes understading a new topic more confusing. Another factor that has led me to create this post is to put together resources in the same order as the exam topics detailed by Cisco. I would, however, strongly recommend that you follow the advice of a true teacher and read a book in order as I have no doupt that the is a great deal of thought has been given into why the book or cideo serials has been layed out.

By far the best book in my opinion.
