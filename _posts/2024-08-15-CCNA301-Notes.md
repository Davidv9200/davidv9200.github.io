# My own take on a CCNA Study Guide

The goal of this page is to offer a straightforward and helpful guide to the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification. There are tons of great free and paid resources out there websites, books, and video courses — but I found some of them a bit confusing, with topics overlapping and making it harder to get a clear understanding.

I had better luck learning the CCNA material in the order laid out by the official CCNA topics. So, I’ve put together this page to follow that same structure.

I personally learn best by taking things step by step and checking off each topic as I go. I also find it really useful to get hands-on practice, so each topic here comes with a practical task to help you apply what you’ve learned. Real-world examples are the best way to make the theory stick.

You’ll find each topic broken down into bullet points with brief explanations, plus a summary at the end to cover the key points you need to know to pass the CCNA.

If you hit a snag with any topics, I would recomend sticking with the topic and use a mix of resources like video tutorials, technical pages, and blog posts to get a better grip only the moving onto the next topic. 

# Prerequisites

Here are some software tools and resources I recommend to help with learning the material for the certification:

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: This network emulation software is invaluable for demonstrating network activity and configuring Cisco switches and routers. It also allows for basic configuration of PCs and servers, making it a great tool for hands-on practice. [PacketTracer 8 Download](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)

- **Wireshark**: A powerful tool for examining frames, packets, and segments. Wireshark is particularly useful for seeing real-world examples of network activity and understanding how data travels through a network. [Wireshark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/#downloadLinkRL)

- **Topic Check-off Sheet**: A helpful resource for tracking your progress through the various topics. This sheet will help you keep track of what you've studied and what you still need to cover.[Check-off Sheet](/assets/Docs/2023_CCNAExam_StudyTool.pdf)

These tools and resources will support your learning journey and help solidify your understanding of networking concepts.


# 1.0 Network Fundamentals
The topics below constitute 20 percent of the CCNA 301 exam as of August 2024. This section tests your understanding of the essential components and concepts that form the foundation of networking, including their roles, functions, and configurations within a business network.

## 1.1.x Explain the role and function of network components
The topics in 1.1.x are designed to test and demonstrate knowledge of the various components that comprise a business network.

## 1.1.a Routers:

**Exam requirements for 1.1.a:**\
How routers forward data packets, connect multiple networks, and provide network segmentation.


### Packet Forwarding Process

1. **Router receives a data packet on one of its interfaces.**

2. **Check packet integrity**
   - Ensure the packet hasn't been corrupted.

3. **Decapsulate frame header and trailer**
   - Reveals the network layer packet.

4. **Examine destination IP address in the packet's header**

5. **Search routing table for the destination IP address**
   - **Is there a matching route?**
     - **Yes:**
       - Identify the outgoing interface and the next hop (another router or the destination device itself).
     - **No:**
       - **Default route configured?**
         - **Yes:** Use default route.
         - **No:** Discard the packet and may send an ICMP "destination unreachable" message to the source.

6. **Encapsulate the IP packet into a new frame for the next network segment**
   - Include the MAC address of the next hop or the final destination on the local network.

7. **Send the frame out through the appropriate interface towards the next hop**

8. **Process repeats at each subsequent router until the packet reaches its final destination.**

## Router Modes
Getting to grips with Cisco routers means understanding the different configuration modes and how to navigate them. Each mode is designed for specific tasks, from basic management to advanced routing setup.

### User EXEC Mode
 the User EXEC mode is the initial mode entered after logging into a Cisco router, It provides a limited set of commands primarily used for basic monitoring and troubleshooting tasks.

| Command                  | Description                                                 |

| write memory                     | Writes the current configuration to memory (same as copy running-config startup-config) |

### Global Configuration Mode
Global Configuration Mode is a configuration mode where you can make changes to the device's overall system configuration. It allows the configuration of features and parameters that affect the entire device, as opposed to specific interfaces or protocols.

| Command                          | Description                                                             |

### Router Configuration Mode
Router Configuration Mode is a sub-mode of Global Configuration Mode used to configure routing protocols on a router. This mode allows the user to define and manage the routing protocols and related parameters that the router will use to forward packets between networks.

| Command                          | Description                                                             |

**1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches:** Knowledge of how Layer 2 switches use MAC addresses for data forwarding within a network and how Layer 3 switches perform routing functions using IP addresses.

**Layer 2 Switches:**

- **Overview:** Layer 2 switches operate at the data link layer of the OSI model. They are responsible for forwarding data within the same local area network (LAN) by using MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
  
- **Function:**
  - **MAC Address Table:** Layer 2 switches maintain a MAC address table that maps the MAC addresses of connected devices to specific ports on the switch.
  - **Data Forwarding:** When a frame (data packet) arrives at the switch, the switch reads the destination MAC address from the frame's header. It then looks up this MAC address in its table to determine the correct port to forward the frame to.
  - **Broadcast Domain:** Layer 2 switches typically operate within a single broadcast domain, meaning that broadcast frames (frames sent to all devices in the network) are forwarded to all ports except the one that received the frame.

**Layer 3 Switches:**

- **Overview:** Layer 3 switches operate at both the data link layer and the network layer of the OSI model. They combine the functionality of a Layer 2 switch and a router.
  
- **Function:**
  - **Routing:** Unlike Layer 2 switches, Layer 3 switches can perform routing functions. They use IP addresses and routing tables to determine the best path for data packets to travel across different networks.
  - **IP Address Table:** Layer 3 switches maintain an IP address table and a routing table, which they use to forward packets based on IP addresses.
  - **VLAN Routing:** Layer 3 switches can route traffic between different VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), which are created to segment network traffic within a single physical network.

**Comparison:**

- **Layer 2 Switches:**
  - Use MAC addresses for data forwarding.
  - Operate within a single LAN.
  - Typically used for connecting devices within the same network.

- **Layer 3 Switches:**
  - Use IP addresses for routing data between different networks.
  - Can perform functions of both a switch and a router.
  - Used for inter-VLAN routing and connecting different networks.

Understanding the roles of Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches helps in designing and managing efficient and scalable networks, ensuring proper data flow and network segmentation.
