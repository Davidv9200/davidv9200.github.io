# My own take on a CCNA Study Guide

The goal of this page is to offer a straightforward and helpful guide to the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification. There are tons of great free and paid resources out there websites, books, and video courses — but I found some of them a bit confusing, with topics overlapping and making it harder to get a clear understanding.

I had better luck learning the CCNA material in the order laid out by the official CCNA topics. So, I’ve put together this page to follow that same structure.

I personally learn best by taking things step by step and checking off each topic as I go. I also find it really useful to get hands-on practice, so each topic here comes with a practical task to help you apply what you’ve learned. Real-world examples are the best way to make the theory stick.

You’ll find each topic broken down into bullet points with brief explanations, plus a summary at the end to cover the key points you need to know to pass the CCNA.

If you hit a snag with any topics, I would recomend sticking with the topic and use a mix of resources like video tutorials, technical pages, and blog posts to get a better grip only the moving onto the next topic. 

# Prerequisites

Here are some software tools and resources I recommend to help with learning the material for the certification:

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: This network emulation software is invaluable for demonstrating network activity and configuring Cisco switches and routers. It also allows for basic configuration of PCs and servers, making it a great tool for hands-on practice. [PacketTracer 8 Download](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)

- **Wireshark**: A powerful tool for examining frames, packets, and segments. Wireshark is particularly useful for seeing real-world examples of network activity and understanding how data travels through a network. [Wireshark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/#downloadLinkRL)

- **Topic Check-off Sheet**: A helpful resource for tracking your progress through the various topics. This sheet will help you keep track of what you've studied and what you still need to cover.[Check-off Sheet](/assets/Docs/2023_CCNAExam_StudyTool.pdf)

These tools and resources will support your learning journey and help solidify your understanding of networking concepts.


# 1.0 Network Fundamentals
The topics below constitute 20 percent of the CCNA 301 exam as of August 2024. This section tests your understanding of the essential components and concepts that form the foundation of networking, including their roles, functions, and configurations within a business network.

## 1.1.x Explain the role and function of network components
The topics in 1.1.x are designed to test and demonstrate knowledge of the various components that comprise a business network.

## 1.1.a Routers: -

How routers forward data packets, connect multiple networks, and provide network segmentation.

* Connections: A router connects to two or more data lines from different IP networks.

* Data Packet Handling: When a data packet arrives, the router reads its destination address from the packet header.

* Routing: Using information from its routing table or policy, the router sends the packet to the next network on its path. This process continues from router to router until the packet reaches its final destination.

**1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches:** Knowledge of how Layer 2 switches use MAC addresses for data forwarding within a network and how Layer 3 switches perform routing functions using IP addresses.

**Layer 2 Switches:**

- **Overview:** Layer 2 switches operate at the data link layer of the OSI model. They are responsible for forwarding data within the same local area network (LAN) by using MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
  
- **Function:**
  - **MAC Address Table:** Layer 2 switches maintain a MAC address table that maps the MAC addresses of connected devices to specific ports on the switch.
  - **Data Forwarding:** When a frame (data packet) arrives at the switch, the switch reads the destination MAC address from the frame's header. It then looks up this MAC address in its table to determine the correct port to forward the frame to.
  - **Broadcast Domain:** Layer 2 switches typically operate within a single broadcast domain, meaning that broadcast frames (frames sent to all devices in the network) are forwarded to all ports except the one that received the frame.

**Layer 3 Switches:**

- **Overview:** Layer 3 switches operate at both the data link layer and the network layer of the OSI model. They combine the functionality of a Layer 2 switch and a router.
  
- **Function:**
  - **Routing:** Unlike Layer 2 switches, Layer 3 switches can perform routing functions. They use IP addresses and routing tables to determine the best path for data packets to travel across different networks.
  - **IP Address Table:** Layer 3 switches maintain an IP address table and a routing table, which they use to forward packets based on IP addresses.
  - **VLAN Routing:** Layer 3 switches can route traffic between different VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), which are created to segment network traffic within a single physical network.

**Comparison:**

- **Layer 2 Switches:**
  - Use MAC addresses for data forwarding.
  - Operate within a single LAN.
  - Typically used for connecting devices within the same network.

- **Layer 3 Switches:**
  - Use IP addresses for routing data between different networks.
  - Can perform functions of both a switch and a router.
  - Used for inter-VLAN routing and connecting different networks.

Understanding the roles of Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches helps in designing and managing efficient and scalable networks, ensuring proper data flow and network segmentation.
