# How to Reset VLAN Database on a Cisco Switch

Resetting the VLAN database on a switch can be a handy fix for network hiccups. If you’re running into trouble with VLANs not behaving right, like weird network segments or old settings causing issues, starting fresh can help. By clearing the VLAN database, you’re wiping out any outdated or problematic settings and giving your switch a clean slate. This can solve a lot of common problems and make sure everything’s running smoothly. It’s also a good idea if you’re reconfiguring or changing out switches, so you don’t have leftover settings messing things up.

1. **Access the Switch**
   - Connect to the switch using a console cable or SSH.
   - Log in with your credentials.

2. **Enter Privileged EXEC Mode**
   - Type `enable` and press Enter.
   - Enter your enable password if prompted.

3. **Enter Global Configuration Mode**
   - Type `configure terminal` or `conf t` and press Enter.

4. **Delete VLAN Data**
   - To delete the VLAN database file, use the following command:
     ```bash
     delete vlan.dat
     ```

5. **Confirm Deletion**
   - Confirm the deletion if prompted. Type `y` and press Enter.

6. **Save Configuration**
   - Save your changes to the startup configuration:
     ```bash
     write memory
     ```
   - Or use:
     ```bash
     copy running-config startup-config
     ```

7. **Reboot the Switch**
   - Reboot the switch to apply changes:
     ```bash
     reload
     ```
   - Confirm the reload if prompted.

8. **Verify VLANs**
   - After the switch reboots, verify the VLANs have been reset:
     ```bash
     show vlan brief
     ```

## Notes
- Ensure you have a backup of your configuration before making changes.
- This process will remove all VLAN configurations, so be cautious.
